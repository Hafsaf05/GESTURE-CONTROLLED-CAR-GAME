# GESTURE-CONTROLLED-CAR-GAME
Built this in feb 2025 as my journey on learning gesture controlling with python, this needs a lot of improvements that will be done in the future

This is a work-in-progress project that uses hand gestures to control a virtual car in real-time. Built using Python, MediaPipe, and OpenCV.
